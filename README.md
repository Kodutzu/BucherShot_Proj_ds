## **How to Play Buckshot Mini**

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you play your mini version of Buckshot Roulette:

---

### **Objective**:
Survive the round while strategically managing your decisions. Either shoot yourself or the opponent (Bot) and hope the shell is a blank. The last player standing wins.

---

### **Game Setup**:

1. **Players**:
   - **You**: It's literally you!.
   - **Opponent (Bot)**: A computer bot making strategic decisions.

2. **Shotgun Magazine**:
   - Contains a randomized mix of live (ðŸ”´) and blank (ðŸŸ¢) shells.
   - The shells are drawn randomly during each turn.

### **Gameplay**:

1. **Overall Concept**:  
   - The game revolves around a shotgun loaded with two types of shells:  
     - **Live Bullets** (`ðŸ”´`): Dangerous and can deplete a playerâ€™s charges.  
     - **Blank Bullets** (`ðŸŸ¢`): Harmless but add suspense to the game.  
   - Players take turns firing the shotgun, aiming either at themselves or the opponent (the Bot).  
   - The goal is to manage risk while trying to deplete the opponentâ€™s charges.

---

2. **Game Mechanics**:  
   - **Turns**:  
     - The game alternates between the Player and the Bot.  
     - Each turn involves loading the shotgun with a randomly selected bullet and firing it.  
   - **Choices**:  
     - On your turn, you decide whom to shoot:
       - **Shoot Yourself**: Take the risk, hoping for a blank bullet 
       - **Shoot the Bot**: Risk firing a live bullet to reduce the Botâ€™s charges.
   - The game ends when one player's charges reach zero or when all bullets are used.  

---

3. **Playerâ€™s Turn**:  
   - **Magazine Display**:  
     The lineup of the magazine (e.g., `ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´`) is displayed, providing insight into the remaining live and blank bullets.  
   - **Target Selection**:  
     - Type your username (e.g., `"you"`) to shoot yourself.  
     - Type `"botname"` to shoot the AI opponent.  
   - **Random Shot**:  
     The shotgun randomly selects a shell from the magazine.  
     - If the shell is live (`ðŸ”´`), the target loses one charge.  
     - If the shell is blank (`ðŸŸ¢`), nothing happens.
      
   - **Feedback**:  
     After the shot, the game updates you on:
     - Who was shot.  
     - The type of bullet fired.  
     - Remaining charges for both players.  

---

4. **Botâ€™s Turn**:  
   - The Bot makes decisions based on probabilities:
     - It calculates the likelihood of live (`ðŸ”´`) vs. blank (`ðŸŸ¢`) bullets based on the remaining shells.  
     - It also considers the current charges for both players.
       
   - **Decision Logic**:  
     - If live bullets dominate: The Bot might target you to deplete your charges.  
     - If blanks dominate: The Bot may target itself, preserving its charges.  
     - If probabilities are equal: The Bot might make a random decision, adding unpredictability to the game.
        
   - The Bot announces its target and fires.
  
### _Important: if you shoot yourself with a blank bullet, then you will be given another chance to shoot! This also applies for the bot_

---

5. **Winning the Game**:  
   - The game ends immediately if a playerâ€™s charges drop to zero after a live shell hits.  
     - **If the Botâ€™s charges drop to 0**: You win! ðŸŽ‰  
     - **If your charges drop to 0**: The Bot wins. ðŸ’€
       
   - If all bullets are used and both players still have charges, the game ends in a **Draw**.
   - If Only Live bullet or Only Blank are left in the Magazine, then the game ends in a **Draw** again.

---

### **Additional Features**:

- **Music & Sound Effects**:  
  - The game includes sound effects for firing the shotgun and background music for added immersion.  

- **Settings Customization**:  
  - Modify the `Settings.json` file to adjust the game parameters:
    
    - `No_of_userCharges`: Number of charges (lives) you start with.  
    - `No_of_botCharges`: Number of charges for the Bot.  
    - `No_of_Bullets`: Total bullets (live + blank) in the magazine.
    - `live_ratio`: To Manipulate the Ratio of Live and Blank Bullet

---

### **Game Tips**:
1. **Risk Management**:  
   - Donâ€™t shoot yourself if live bullets dominate the magazine.  
   - When blanks dominate, itâ€™s safer to shoot yourself to avoid giving your opponent an advantage.  

2. **Analyze Probabilities**:  
   - Watch the magazine lineup and remaining bullets to anticipate the odds of drawing a live shell.  

3. **Play Aggressively or Defensively**:  
   - Target the Bot early if you feel confident about the odds.  
   - Play defensively and conserve charges if youâ€™re falling behind.

### Troubleshooting:

1. If the game doesnâ€™t run, ensure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal!
2. Check the Settings.json file for valid configurations.

Enjoy **Buckshot Mini**!
