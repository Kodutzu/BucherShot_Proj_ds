## **How to Play BucherShot Mini**

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you play your mini version of Buckshot Roulette:

---

### **Objective**:
Survive the round while strategically managing your decisions. Either shoot yourself or the opponent (Bot) and hope the shell is a blank. The last player standing wins.

---

### **Game Setup**:

2. **Players**:
   - **You**: The human player.
   - **Opponent (Bot) **: A computer bot making strategic decisions.

3. **Shotgun Magazine**:
   - Contains a randomized mix of live (ðŸ”´) and blank (ðŸŸ¢) shells.
   - The shells are drawn randomly during each turn.

---

### **Gameplay**:

1. **Mechanics**:
   - The game alternates turns between you and the Bot.
   - On your turn, you choose whether to:
     - **Shoot Yourself**: Risk a blank shell to save your opponent's charges.
     - **Shoot the Opponent (AI)**: Risk a live shell to damage your opponent's charges.

2. **Playerâ€™s Turn**:
   - The magazine lineup is displayed (e.g., `ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”´ `).
   - Choose your target:
     - Type **"username"** to shoot yourself.
     - Type **"botname"** to shoot the AI opponent.
   - The shotgun loads a random shell, and the result (live or blank) is revealed.

3. **Botâ€™s Turn**:
   - The Bot assesses the probability of live and blank shells.
   - It also considers your charges and its own before deciding whom to shoot.
   - The Bot announces its decision (self or opponent) and takes the shot.

---

### **Winning the Game**:
- If a playerâ€™s charges drop to **0** after a live shell hits, the game ends:
  - **If Botâ€™s charges drop to 0**: **You Win! ðŸŽ‰**
  - **If your charges drop to 0**: **Bot Wins. ðŸ’€**
- If all bullets are used and both players still have charges, the game ends in a **Draw**.

---

### **Game Tips**:
1. **Manage Risk**:
   - If there are more blanks than live bullets, consider shooting yourself to avoid a live shot on your opponent.
   - If live bullets dominate, try shooting the opponent.
     
2. **Keep an Eye on Charges**:
   - Protect your charges while aiming to deplete the opponentâ€™s.

3. **Monitor the Magazine**:
   - Use the displayed magazine to estimate probabilities and plan your strategy.

---

### **Troubleshooting**:
- If the game doesnâ€™t run, ensure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Check the `Settings.json` file for valid configurations.
- Report any bugs or unexpected behaviours.

Enjoy the thrill of BucherShot Mini! ðŸ¥³
